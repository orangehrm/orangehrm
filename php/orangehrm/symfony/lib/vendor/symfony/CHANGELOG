Version 1.2.8
-------------

This release rolls back the security fix from 1.2.6/1.2.7:

"These changes have been done to plug a security hole in the symfonyadmin generator (more information on the symfony blog:
http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2009/04/27/symfony-1-2-6-security-fix).But a lot of people complained because it
causes more harm than good. The fix disables for instance the possibility to have custom partials. Moreover, the problem
also exists in a normal form if you don't use the "echo $form" construct and if you forget to display some non-required
fields in the template. After some discussion with the core team members, it appears that there is no way to "fix" the
problem for the developer. We thought that we would be able to provide something, but the reality is that we cannot.
Is it a problem? We think it is not a big problem as the circumstances under which there can be an exploit are
extremely rare or even inexistent as if you are vulnerable, it also means that your database data will be corrupted in some
way (read the next section for more information). As a matter of fact, all frameworks around are vulnerable and have the
exact same problem. We already provide more advanced security features for the form framework than anyother framework
around, but we cannot go any further. Security is also a developer matter, and too much magic is sometimes a bad thing.
Here is the exact circumstances under which you might be vulnerable: A field is vulnerable only if you forget to display
its widget inthe template and only if it has a non-required validator. Then, an attacker could potentially inject a valid
value for this field, and it will be saved with the rest of the object. But two things greatly mitigate the issue: first,
if you forget to display a field, each time you save the form, its value will be lost. So, most of the time, you will be
aware of the problem because the data in the database will be corrupted. Second, the attacker need to know the exact field
name, which is not easy as no information is contained in the HTML."
